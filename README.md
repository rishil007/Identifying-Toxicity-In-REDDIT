# Identifying-Toxicity-In-REDDIT

For this project, I have
analyzed the communities, “Valorant”, “BlackBoxDown” and “NomadOfNowhere”. It is
essential to look into various attributes of these communities to get an in-depth understanding of
how these communities work internally, and then analyze toxicity in them. Toxic conduct, such
as harassment, hate speech, and other disruptive acts that impair user experience and community
cohesion, is a common problem for online gaming groups. In order to find patterns and clusters
of toxic interactions inside these subreddit communities, this study uses a multimodal strategy
that combines sentiment analysis, network analysis, topic modelling and data extraction from
Reddit
